Eliza is a computer program which can do logical operations and conversions.
It can perform various operations but there are some things you need to remember while working with Eliza:

1) For writing operand in words upto 100, use a dash to separate them.
   e.g for 44 write 'forty-four'
       for 99 write 'ninety-nine'
       for 68226 write 'sixty-eight thousand two hundred and twenty-six'

2) The limit for writing operands in words is upto 99999 i.e. "ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine".

3) You can write the operand in words in a number of ways
   e.g you can write 1101 as 'one thousand one hundred and one' and also as'eleven hundred and one'
       you can write 4844 as 'four thousand eight hundred and forty-four' and also as'forty-eight hundred and forty-four'

4) When writing operands in words, please make sure you write them in small case only. Dont write them in capital.
   And SEPARATE two operands by a 'AND' (in capital).
   e.g. "What is the logical & of one thousand one hundred and one AND one hundred and one'

5) When writing operands in words, please make sure you write the operator BEFORE the operands
   e.g. "What is the logical OR of one thousand one hundred and one AND eleven'

6) You can use both symbols and words for operators. Words for operators are not affected by case size
   For AND you can use: 'and', 'And', 'AND', '&'
   For OR you can use: 'or', 'Or', 'OR', '|'
   For XOR you can use: 'xor', 'XOR', 'Xor', '^'
   For NOT you can use: 'not', 'NOT, 'Not', '!'
   To convert to binary you can use: 'bit', 'Bit', 'BIT', 'binary', 'Binary', 'BINARY'
   To convert to decimal you can use: 'decimal', 'Decimal', 'DECIMAL'

7) To stop Eliza write 'end', 'End' or 'END'
